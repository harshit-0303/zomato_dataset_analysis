What I Found – SQL Analysis on Zomato Dataset  
This project explores the Zomato restaurant dataset using SQL to extract key insights across various dimensions. Below are the major areas analyzed:

1. Rating Distribution & Trends : 
Average rating by city and price range,
Best and worst rated cuisines,
Top 10 most voted and highly rated restaurants,
Overall distribution of ratings.

2. Rating-Based Filtering : 
Top-rated restaurants by city and locality,
High-rated restaurants offering delivery or table booking,
Currently delivering restaurants with rating > 4.5,
Top-rated restaurants across different price ranges.

3. Comparative Insights : 
Ratings comparison: with vs. without table booking,
Ratings comparison: delivery vs. no delivery,
Top-rated restaurants (rating > 4.5) by cuisine,
Cost vs. rating analysis.

4. Group-Based Aggregations : 
Average rating per cuisine,
Locality-wise rating and restaurant count,
City-wise rating leaderboard,
Rating segmentation: Gold (4.5–5), Silver (4–4.4), Bronze (3–3.9), Low-rated (<3).

5. Outlier Detection : 
High rating but low votes,
High votes but low rating (potentially overrated),
High cost (≥2000) with very low rating (≤1).

6. Predictive Insights : 
Relationship between cost and rating,
Most consistent price range in terms of rating,
City with the highest average cost.

This project used SQL to extract meaningful insights from the Zomato dataset, covering trends in ratings, pricing, cuisines, and service options. It also included comparative and outlier analysis to understand restaurant performance across cities.

To enhance the analysis, I created a Power BI dashboard that visually explores the dataset with filters for city, price range, rating, and more—making the insights more interactive and accessible.
